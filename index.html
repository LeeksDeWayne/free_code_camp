            <h2 id="title">Nipsey Hussle</h2>
            <p id='tribute-info'><strong>Ermias Joseph Asghedom</strong> (August 15, 1985 – March 31, 2019), known professionally as <strong>Nipsey Hussle</strong> (visit a <a id="tribute-link" href="https://www.lataco.com/nipsey-hussle-murals/" target="_blank">memorial website</a> dedicated to Nipsey Hussle), was an American rapper, activist, and entrepreneur. Emerging from the West Coast hip hop scene in the mid-2000s, Nipsey Hussle independently released his first mixtape, <i>Slauson Boy Volume 1</i>, to moderate local success, which led to him being signed to Cinematic Music Group and Epic Records.</p>

            <p id="intro-text2">Nipsey Hussle became known for his numerous mixtapes, including his <i>Bullets Ain't Got No Name</i> series, <i>The Marathon</i>, <i>The Marathon Continues</i>, and <i>Crenshaw</i>, the last of which rapper Jay-Z bought 100 copies for $100 each. After much delay, his debut studio album <i>Victory Lap</i> was released in 2018 to critical acclaim and commercial success, and was nominated for the Best Rap Album at the 61st Grammy Awards in 2019. Two posthumous Grammy Awards for the songs "Racks in the Middle" and "Higher" were awarded to Nipsey Hussle in the Best Rap Performance and Best Rap/Sung Performance categories, respectively, the next year (2020) at the 62nd Grammy Awards.</p>
                
            <p>Also known for his entrepreneurship, Nipsey Hussle inaugurated the Marathon Clothing store, which he founded along with partners Carless, the head of the agency, Karen Civil and his brother Samiel Asghedom in 2017, and started a co-working environment which he named "Vector 90". On March 31, 2019, Hussle was fatally shot outside his store Marathon Clothing in South Los Angeles. Eric Holder, a 29-year-old man who had confronted Nipsey Hussle earlier in the day, was arrested and charged with murder on April 2, 2019.</p>

            <h3 id="early-life-title">Early Life</h3>
            <p id="early-life-text">Ermias Joseph Asghedom was born on August 15, 1985, in Crenshaw, Los Angeles, California, to Angelique Smith, an African-American woman, and Dawit Asghedom, an Eritrean immigrant. He was raised in the Crenshaw neighborhood of South Los Angeles with his brother Samuel and his sister Samantha. Ermias Asghedom attended Alexander Hamilton High School in the nearby Castle Heights neighborhood, but dropped out before graduating. At the age of 14, Ermias Asghedom left home and joined the local Rollin 60's Neighborhood Crips, a sub-group of the larger Crips gang primarily based in his home neighborhood of Crenshaw. His stage name, a play on the name of comedian Nipsey Russell, originated as a nickname given to Ermias Asghedom by a childhood friend. At the age of 19, Asghedom's father took both him and his brother Samuel on a trip to Eritrea, East Africa for three months in 2004. Asghedom credited the trip with inspiring him to become a community activist with an "entrepreneurial spirit".</p>

            <h3 id="music-career-title">Music Career</h3>
            
            <h4 id="2008-title">2008-2010: <i>Bullets Ain't Got No Name</i> Series</h4>
            <p id="2008-text">In December 2005, Nipsey Hussle independently released his first mixtape, <i>Slauson Boy Volume 1</i>, to moderate local success. His debut project helped to build a small regional fanbase on the west coast, and eventually led to Nipsey Hussle being signed to Cinematic Music Group and Epic Records. In 2008, Nipsey Hussle released the first two installments in his <i>Bullets Ain't Got No Name</i> series of mixtapes, which helped to bring Nipsey Hussle's music to a larger audience.</p>
                
            <p id="2008-text2">Nipsey Hussle's profile continued to grow into 2009, when he collaborated with Drake on the song "Killer", and also appeared, along with Snoop Dogg and Problem, on the song "Upside Down", from Snoop Dogg's 2009 album <i>Malice n Wonderland</i>. He also released the third instalment in <i>Bullets Ain’t Got No Name</i>, as well as his commercial debut single, "Hussle in the House". Despite the song, which samples Kris Kross' 1992 single "Jump", being well received by critics, it failed to make any impact on the charts.</p>
                
            <p id="2008-text3">After Epic experienced financial issues in 2010, Nipsey Hussle opted not to renew his contract and left the label. Not long after going independent, Nipsey Hussle appeared on the song "We Are the World 25 for Haiti", and was featured by XXL Magazine as one of its "Annual Freshman Top Ten", a selection of ten up-and-coming hip-hop artists to watch. XXL labeled him "Most Determined" of his class, and LA Weekly called him the "next big L.A. MC". Nipsey Hussle was expected to release his debut album, <i>South Central State of Mind</i>, in October 2010. Prior to release, the album was supported by the single "Feelin' Myself" featuring Lloyd. While the production was set to be handled from J.R. Rotem, Scott Storch, Mr. Lee, Play-N-Skillz, Terrace Martin and 1500 or Nothin', the album was set to be featured with the guest appearances from Trey Songz, Jay Rock and Sean Kingston. Concurrently, he announced that he planned on releasing a mixtape with fellow rapper Jay Rock, titled Red and Blue Make Green. Following the release of a music video for "Feelin' Myself", the album was set for a December 21, 2010, release; however, both of these projects were eventually postponed indefinitely.</p>

            <h4 id="2010-title">2010-2013: Leaving Epic Reocrds and <i>The Marathon</i> Series</h4>
            <p id="2010-text">After leaving Epic Records, Nipsey Hussle founded his own record label, All Money In. On December 21, 2010, he released his first All Money In Records mixtape, titled <i>The Marathon</i>, which featured guest appearances from Kokane and MGMT. On November 1, 2011, Nipsey Hussle released a sequel titled <i>The Marathon Continues</i>, which featured L.A. rappers YG and Dom Kennedy. On April 17, 2012, Nispey Hussle released a collaborative album with fellow rapper Blanco, Raw. The album featured guest appearances from YG, Mistah FAB, Yukmouth, B-Legit, Kokane and Freeway.</p>

            <p id="2010-text2">In May 2012, Nipsey Hussle released a single titled "Proud of That", marking his first collaboration with Florida rapper Rick Ross. Nipsey Hussle was subsequently featured on Ross' Maybach Music Group's song "Fountain of Youth", which appears on the label's second album <i>Self Made Vol. 2</i>. The music video was released on October 1, 2012. Rumours began to circulate that Nipsey Hussle would sign with MMG, and in December 2012, Hussle himself hinted at signing, however, he also said that he was still looking for the right label.</p>
                
            <p id="2010-text3">Nipsey Hussle said that he would be releasing his third and final installment of <i>The Marathon</i> mixtape series with <i>TM3: Victory Lap</i> in 2013, after it was pushed back from its initial December 2012 release date. He also announced that he was planning on releasing a joint mixtape with a fellow West Coast rapper and frequent collaborator YG. Nipsey Hussle performed at the 2013 Paid Dues festival on March 30, 2013 in California. After deciding against signing to a major label, due to a lack of creative freedom, he choose to make <i>Victory Lap</i> his debut album.</p>

            <h4 id="2013-title">2013-2019: <i>Crenshaw</i> and <i>Victory Lap</i></h4>
            <p id="2013-text">Beginning in 2013, he released various songs from his upcoming mixtape <i>Crenshaw</i>, including the 9th Wonder produced track "Face the World", and a The Futuristics and 1500 or Nothin' produced track "Blessings". On August 6, 2013, Nipsey Hussle announced that <i>Victory Lap</i> would be released as an album, rather than a mixtape. Prior to the release of <i>Victory Lap</i>, Nipsey Hussle announced on September 16, 2013, that he would be releasing a new mixtape, <i>Crenshaw</i> (hosted by DJ Drama), on October 8, 2013. On September 24, 2013, he revealed the track list for <i>Crenshaw</i>, which contained guest appearances from Rick Ross, Dom Kennedy, Slim Thug, James Fauntleroy II, Z-Ro, Skeme and Sade, among others. The production on the mixtape was handled by The Futuristics, 1500 or Nothin', 9th Wonder, Mike Free, Ralo and Jiggy Hendrix, among others. He also released the <i>Crenshaw</i> documentary that day in promotion of the mixtape. On October 3, 2013, he released another trailer for the mixtape, and attracted attention when he revealed 1,000 hard copies of the mixtape would be sold for $100 each. Jay Z personally bought 100 copies. He reportedly sold out all 1,000 copies in less than 24 hours, effectively making $100,000.</p>

            <p id="2013-text2">Upon the release of <i>Crenshaw</i>, Nipsey Hussle said that <i>Victory Lap</i> would be released in 2014. On November 20, 2013, Nipsey Hussle confirmed that <i>Victory Lap</i> would feature production from Ralo, 1500 or Nothin', The Futuristiks and DJ Mustard. He later confirmed more producers, including Don Cannon and DJ Khalil on the album. After the year went by with no new releases, Nipsey Hussle released a new mixtape, <i>Mailbox Money</i> on New Year's Eve 2014, again releasing 1000 hard copies for $100 each.</p>

            <p id="2013-text3">Hussle made a number of guest appearances throughout 2015 and 2016, working with Jadakiss, Trae Tha Truth and YG. In 2016, he released another mixtape, titled <i>Famous Lies</i> and <i>Unpopular Truth</i>. He commented on the 2016 US presidential election by releasing the single "FDT" ("Fuck Donald Trump") with YG; the song was written about Nipsey Hussle's positive experiences with Mexican immigrants in the United States, whom Trump had criticized.</p>

            <p id="2013-text4">After numerous delays, Nipsey Hussle's debut studio album, <i>Victory Lap</i>, was released on February 16, 2018, debuting at number 4 on the Billboard 200, selling 53,000 album equivalent units in its first week. The album was met with universal acclaim from critics, and numerous songs entered the Billboard Hot 100, including "Double Up", "Last Time I Checc'd" and "Dedication", marking Nipsey Hussle's debut on the chart as a lead artist. <i>Victory Lap</i> was also nominated for a Best Rap Album at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards in 2019, but lost out to Cardi B's <i>Invasion of Privacy</i>. Over 1 year after its release, the album reached a new peak of number 2 on the Billboard 200 in April 2019 after Nipsey Hussle's murder on March 31. His single "Racks in the Middle" featuring Roddy Ricch and Hit-Boy also reached a new peak of number 44 on the Hot 100, following his death.</p>

            <h3 id="business-ventures-title">Business Ventures</h3>
            <p id="business-ventures-text">Nipsey Hussle's nickname came from his entrepreneurial spirit. He shined shoes for $2.50 to pay for school clothes at age 11 with a goal of a hundred shoes a day. Nipsey Hussle sold his mixtapes out of a car trunk at a neighborhood strip mall at the intersection of Slauson Avenue and Crenshaw Boulevard. After leaving Epic Records, he founded his own record label. Nipsey Hussle experimented with unorthodox sales strategies by selling expensive copies of certain mixtapes even while the songs were distributed for free.</p>

            <p id="business-ventures-text2">Nipsey Hussle's Marathon branding inspired Steve Carless in 2013 when he founded Marathon Agency with business partners Karen Civil and Jorge Peniche. They designed the talent-based brand to attract a diverse set of clients in all stages of their careers. In October 2016, Carless, the head of the agency, told Billboard that Nipsey Hussle had invested "like over six figures" in the Marathon Agency and described him as "kind of like our silent partner."</p>

            <p id="business-ventures-text3">Nipsey Hussle opened the Marathon Clothing store on June 17, 2017, which he founded along with partners Carless, Civil, and his brother Samiel Asghedom. Opening the store at this intersection in the Crenshaw commercial district was important to him because he wanted to invest and provide opportunities in his neighborhood of Hyde Park. The store is billed as a "smart store," which bridges the gap between culture and technology by giving customers access to exclusive music and other content created by rappers through an app created by software engineer Iddris Sandu. The year before his death, Nipsey Hussle had bought the small shopping center where his store was located, after partnering with the real estate investor David Gross.</p>

            <h4 id="all-money-in-title">All Money In</h4>
            <p id="all-money-in-text">Nipsey Hussle created the record label All Money In after leaving Epic Records. He released his first major project, <i>The Marathon</i>, through the new label on December 21, 2010. He released subsequent projects under his label, including <i>The Marathon Continues</i> (2011), <i>Crenshaw</i> (2013), and <i>Mailbox Money</i> (2014). He also signed other artists, including J Stone, Pacman Da Gunman, BH, Cobby Supreme, Cuzzy Capone and Killa Twan.</p>

            <p id="community-activism-text">Nipsey Hussle wanted to focus on "giving solutions and inspiration" to young black men like him. He denounced gun violence through his music, influence and community work. He spoke openly about his experiences with gang culture.</p>

            <p id="community-activism-text2">He funded improvements to neighborhood schools and spent time with students, also participating on panels about growing up in the area and the influence of gang culture. Nipsey Hussle started a co-working environment which he named Vector 90. From his own experience, he believed that the Crenshaw area as being underserved and that young people would benefit from communal workspaces. He wanted youths to be able to take classes in science, technology and mathematics at the center. Hussle was also intimately involved in the planning and advisory stages of the Destination Crenshaw project that will showcase the history and culture of African Americans in his neighborhood. In March 2019, Nipsey Hussle had contacted officials from the Los Angeles Police Department to arrange a meeting with him and Roc Nation about what they could do to help prevent gang violence in South Los Angeles. The meeting had been scheduled to take place on April 1, 2019. </p>

            <p id="community-activism-text3">Nipsey Hussle was murdered on March 31, 2019. According to Los Angeles Police Commissioner: Steve Soboroff, department officials will meet with Nipsey Hussle's representatives at a future date on these issues, to continue the activist's work in his honor.</p>

            <h3 id="death-title">Death</h3>
            <p id="death-text">On March 31, 2019, Nipsey Hussle was shot at least 10 times in the parking lot of his store, Marathon Clothing, in South Los Angeles at about 15:19 hours. Gunshot wounds included a shot to his right chest, a shot that entered into his abdomen near his navel and severed his spine, a gunshot wound to the right side of his back that penetrated into his chest and struck his lung, and a gunshot wound to "the posterior top" of his scalp. Two others were wounded in the shooting. All three victims were transported to a hospital, where Nipsey Hussle was pronounced dead at 15:55 hours. He was 33 years old. Rapper GBO Gaston claimed to have killed Nipsey Hussle on an Instagram post before the suspected perpetrator was arrested. Police identified 29-year-old Eric Ronald Holder Jr. as the suspect.</p>
            
            <p id="death-text2">Investigators believe Eric Holder, the suspect, was known to the rapper and that the shooting was possibly motivated by a personal matter. On April 2, 2019, Holder was arrested by the Los Angeles Police Department and was being held in solitary confinement. On May 9, a grand jury indicted Holder on one count of murder, two counts each of attempted murder and assault with a firearm, and one count of possession of a firearm by a felon. On February 9, 2020, Judge Robert Perry said he hoped to begin the murder trial by early April 2020.</p>
